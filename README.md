# Heart Attack Risk Predictor - Streamlit App

A Streamlit web application for predicting heart attack risk using an ensemble machine learning model (XGBoost + CatBoost).

## Features

- **Ensemble Model**: Combines XGBoost and CatBoost models for accurate predictions
- **Hybrid Dual-Threshold Risk Mapping**: Three mapping strategies (Standard, Mapping A for high recall, Mapping B for high precision)
- **SHAP Explanations**: Model interpretability with feature importance for each prediction
- **Reason String Generation**: Human-readable explanations of risk factors
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive form-based input for patient information
- **Real-time Predictions**: Instant risk assessment with probability scores
- **Detailed Analysis**: Shows predictions from individual models and ensemble
- **Responsive Design**: Clean and modern UI

## Model Performance

- **Accuracy**: ~85%
- **ROC-AUC**: ~92%
- **Precision**: ~85%
- **Recall**: ~84%

## Installation

### Option 1: Using Docker (Recommended)

1. Make sure Docker Desktop is running
2. Build and run the container:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
3. The app will be available at `http://localhost:8501`

### Option 2: Local Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kbssrikar7/streamlit_heart_app.git
cd streamlit_heart_app
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Training the Model

Before running the Streamlit app, you need to train the models:

1. Place your dataset `cardio_train_extended.csv` in the project root directory
2. Run the training script:
```bash
python train_model.py
```

This will:
- Train XGBoost and CatBoost models
- Save the models and preprocessor to the `models/` directory
- Generate feature information files

## Running the App Locally

Once the models are trained, run the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The app will open in your default web browser at `http://localhost:8501`

## Deployment on Streamlit Cloud

1. Push this repository to GitHub
2. Go to [share.streamlit.io](https://share.streamlit.io)
3. Click "New app"
4. Connect your GitHub repository
5. Select the `streamlit_heart_app` directory
6. Set main file to `app.py`
7. Deploy!

**Important**: Make sure to include the `models/` directory in your GitHub repository (or use a cloud storage solution).

## Usage

1. Fill in the patient information form:
   - Demographics (Gender, Height, Weight)
   - Blood Pressure measurements
   - Medical History (Cholesterol, Glucose, Smoking, Alcohol)
   - Physical Activity status
   - Additional health metrics

2. Click "🔮 Predict Heart Attack Risk"

3. Select Risk Mapping Strategy (in sidebar):
   - **Standard**: Balanced precision and recall (threshold 50%)
   - **Mapping A (High Recall)**: Better for screening, treats moderate risk as at-risk (threshold 30%)
   - **Mapping B (High Precision)**: Reduces false alarms, treats moderate risk as safe (threshold 70%)

4. View the results:
   - Risk probability percentage
   - Risk level (High/Low)
   - Reason string with key risk factors
   - SHAP explanations (feature importance)
   - Detailed model breakdown
   - Recommendations based on risk level

## Features Used by the Model

The model uses the following features:

### Numeric Features:
- Gender, Height, Weight
- Blood Pressure (Systolic, Diastolic)
- BMI, Pulse Pressure
- Age, Lifestyle Score
- Protein Level, Ejection Fraction
- And more...

### Categorical Features:
- Age Group (Young/Middle/Senior)
- BMI Category (Underweight/Normal/Overweight/Obese)
- BP Category (Normal/Elevated/High Stage 1/High Stage 2)
- Risk Level (Low/Moderate/High)

## Model Architecture
