# Deploying with GitHub Desktop - Quick Guide

Your repository is already initialized and committed! Follow these simple steps:

## Steps to Publish:

1. **Open GitHub Desktop**
   - Launch GitHub Desktop application

2. **Add Your Local Repository**
   - Click "File" → "Add Local Repository"
   - Browse to: `/Users/happy/Documents/Code/streamlit_heart_app`
   - Click "Add repository"

3. **Publish to GitHub**
   - In GitHub Desktop, you should see your repository
   - Click the "Publish repository" button (top right)
   - OR go to "Repository" → "Publish repository"
   
4. **Configure Publishing**
   - Repository name: `heart-attack-risk-predictor` (or any name you like)
   - Description (optional): "Heart Attack Risk Predictor using ML Ensemble Models"
   - Choose: **Public** or **Private**
   - Uncheck "Keep this code private" if you want it public
   - Click "Publish Repository"

5. **Done!**
   - Your code will be pushed to GitHub
   - You can now deploy on Streamlit Cloud!

## After Publishing:

1. Go to https://share.streamlit.io
2. Sign in with your GitHub account
3. Click "New app"
4. Select your repository: `heart-attack-risk-predictor`
5. Set Main file path: `app.py`
6. Click "Deploy!"

## Troubleshooting:

If GitHub Desktop doesn't show your repository:
- Make sure you're in the correct folder
- The repository should show as "Current repository: streamlit_heart_app" at the top

If you see "No local changes":
- That's fine! Your initial commit is ready to push
